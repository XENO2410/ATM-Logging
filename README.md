# ATM Logging

This project involves developing a mobile ATM application that handles bank transactions such as deposits and withdrawals. The original design used print statements to print helpful information to the console. The goal of this project is to modify the existing `BankAccount` methods to utilize the logging module instead of print statements. Using the logging module will make the project code more readable and maintainable.

## Project Overview

- Amounts entered for each transaction

- Date and timestamps for each transaction

### Modifications

The modified application will:
- Utilize the logging module instead of print statements
- Enhance code readability and maintainability
